Gasket Failure Reliability Analysis
This project investigates gasket failures in industrial equipment, focusing on reliability analysis and preventive maintenance strategies. The case highlights how gasket failures can cause significant production losses (30–70%) depending on the failure location.
Objectives
•	Analyze gasket failure data and document assumptions.
•	Apply reliability analysis methods (e.g., Why-Why Analysis, FTA).
•	Propose actions to improve gasket reliability.
•	Recommend proactive and preventive maintenance practices.
•	Outline a vision, goals, and implementation timeline for long-term reliability improvements.
Dataset
Failure records include dates, failure modes, and causes such as:
•	Contamination / Foreign Particles
•	Wear and Fatigue
•	Out-of-Spec Gaskets
•	External Corrosion
•	Defective Components
Methods & Tools
•	ReliaSoft Weibull++: Performed reliability analysis, model fitting, and failure distribution evaluation.
•	Excel: Used for failure data organization, statistical calculations, and visual summaries.
•	Reliability Modeling: Weibull analysis, FTA (Fault Tree Analysis), and comparative failure rate studies.
Key Findings
•	Frequent failures linked to contamination, corrosion, and out-of-spec gaskets.
•	Current “replace on failure” culture leads to avoidable production losses.
•	Predictable wear/fatigue patterns suggest benefits from preventive intervals.
Recommendations
•	Standardize gasket procurement with strict quality checks.
•	Implement preventive replacement intervals based on Weibull analysis.
•	Use data-driven decision-making for maintenance scheduling (ReliaSoft + Excel).
•	Introduce proactive monitoring techniques and staff training.
•	Adopt ISO 14224 framework for consistent failure classification.
Expected Outcomes
By leveraging ReliaSoft and Excel analysis, this project aims to:
•	Reduce production losses caused by gasket failures.
•	Improve equipment reliability and maintenance efficiency.
•	Provide a structured roadmap for proactive reliability management.
